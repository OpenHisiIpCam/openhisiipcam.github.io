It covers some part of market that is related to China, as China is largest supplier of such devices all over the world. Big part of information was gotten from talks with Security Market ( HuaQuanBei area) sellers. Also some info came from security exhibitions in Shenzhen (Guangdong, China). Mostly information applicable to low-end and middle-end segments of market. Chip makers Chip maker means company that develop and produce specialized System on Chips (or just chips). There aren`t so much such companies. Here's our list of companies whose chips we've seen. Hisilicon Texas Instruments GrainMedia Ambarella XM Texas Instruments DM365, DM368 modules were widely exist on the market about 5 years ago. Some their more advanced SoC DM8127 were used by HikVision in their exclusive hardware platforms. Now seems they exist only in high-end segment. Ambarella were exist on the market several years ago, but now seems moved their focus for action cameras and car DVRs. According their website they still have ip camera SoC, but seems they used not very widely and exist only in high end segment. GrainMedia is a new player, they jumped in a few years ago with series of extreamly low-end solutions. During late 2017/beginning of 2018 XM introduces camera modules based on their own SoC. There are no public technical info about it at the moment. As about HiSilicon , that is part of Huawei corporation, their chips have firmly occupied low-end and middle-end segments. \u0421ompared to competitors, HiSilicon doesn`t care much about hiding their SDKs and it can be obtain without NDA and other bullshit. Camera modules manufacturers Based on HiSilicon`s reference design companies make camera modules. As mostly everything is included inside System on a Chip, there are no area to creative ideas (we are really lucky ). There are mostly nowhere developer of the camera PCB can implement his own vision. The only thing that will be under developer`s control is which interfaces to use on target module, like additional UART or USB host. Most known companies: XM - very popular one, if you will dissamble chinese ip camera most probably their module is inside. JVT - this one faster than others introduces solutions based on new chips. TopSee - another one, that has english version of website. HSELL ??? - not sure, that it is original vendor, maybe reseller HEROSPEED LONSE JOVISION There are others, search taobao to find some. Usually such companies not only sell camera modules alone, but also offer modules inside cases with attached lens . Camera as product for the end user When normal people hear ip camera, they think about some box with optical lens. But still the end user camera is the same camera module inserted in metal (sometime plastic) case. Case itself performs function of lens holder and protection for PCB. Sometimes it is a bit more complicated when PoE comes into game or lens is motorized, but it is out of this article`s scope. A lot of chinese companies buy components (cases, lens, camera module PCB, wires, screws), assemble all together, print logo and pack inside fancy box. Obvious that all such companies produce completely same devices, that just looks like different. This is applicable to most HiSilicon based devices.","title":"Chinese CCTV market"},{"location":"cctv/chinese-cctv-market/#overview-of-chinese-cctv-market","text":"This overview doesn`t cover all video surveilliance market.

But we can split them in several groups. analog ( composite output interface) advanced analog ( custom vendor solutions in some sense similar to analog, but allow to transmit better quality video on longer distance) SDI ( Serial Digital Interface output interface) ip cameras (ethernet output interface) Analog cameras gives us 25/30 fps video with resolution like VGA (640x480). Custom advanced analog like AHD gives us 720p HD video. SDI cameras gives typically 1080p FullHD video. All these 3 types of cameras outputs uncompressed raw signal. Ip cameras are not limited in resolution (you can find solutions from 720p30 up to 8K30 with new hi3559av100 chip from HiSilicon) as they outputs compressed video (that cause some delay unfortunately). What camera consis of All of these types of cameras mostly consist of CCD or CMOS (now it will be CMOS for 90%) image capture sensor and System on a Chip. SoC has input and output interface. Image sensor is connected to SoC`s input interface. SoC is capturing images from sensor, do some image processing and pass video to output interface. All other components that you can see on the camera module is just needed to turn on the sensor and SoC (more about it you can read on hardware explained page). SoC incapsulate mostly all things needed to capture, process and output video. So, you can recognize camera as a pair CMOS+SoC . What we can influence SoC itself is a small computer. If we are talking about analog, AHD or SDI cameras than such computer is based on CPU like Intel 8051 . There will be some program that such CPU runs. Such program is configuring internal components of the SoC and implements some user control via buttons or even rs-232. Not very interesting, as there is no ability to run tons of existing software and mostly nothing to control, all available functions of SoC are implemented by camera module manufacturer already. If we are talking about ip cameras, than it means that SoC is based on full featured ARM cpu running GNU/Linux . Actually, you can compare it with something like Raspberry Pi mini computer (main difference from first look will be absence of HDMI video output, interesting that SoCs themself support such interface, but manufacturers don`t include it in hardware, as it usually doesn`t needed). In this case there are tons of existing software that we can run on camera module, moreover comparing to other arm based mini computers we will have advanced video processing ablities in our hands. Also typically there are USB host interface, audio in/out interfaces and even some low level interfaces like UART, SPI, I2C. That means we can connect a lot of exiting external devices (like WiFi modules, 4G modems, temperature sensors, etc). Conclusion Important Mostly everything you need to know about ip camera, that it is just simple arm based computer connected to CMOS sensor placed on same PCB running GNU/Linux .","title":"What ip camera is"},{"location":"cctv/what-ip-camera-is/#what-ip-camera-is","text":"","title":"What ip camera is"},{"location":"cctv/what-ip-camera-is/#what-types-of-cameras-are-there","text":"There are a lot of different types of security surveillance cameras.

Our catalog covers only small part of all existing compatible hardware, also we lack pinouts description . If you have some usefull information pls share it with us . Not all of these modules is easy to buy at the moment, like it will be very difficult to buy solution based on hi3516cv100, as it is mostly outdated (but still there are a lot of such hardware is used widely by people).
