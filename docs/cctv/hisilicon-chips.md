# Overview of HiSilicon`s SoCs for ip cameras

We splitted chips in groups, that we call *family*. Chips in a family have same CPU architecture, share same vendor SDK and 
usually differs in only video processing capability terms.

## Other

There is new, very powerfull chip **hi3559av100** ([brief](/cctv/briefs/hi3559av100.pdf)), but there are not real massive products based on it.
Also hardware development kit is still expensive at the moment. So, we will postpone it.

Also there is new **hi3516cv500** cooming, but still no official information.
