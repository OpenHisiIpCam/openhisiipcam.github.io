# Overview of chinese cctv market

This overview doesn`t cover all video surveilliance market. It covers some part of market that is related to China, 
as China is largest supplier of such devices all over the world.
Big part of information was gotten from talks with Security Market ([HuaQuanBei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huaqiangbei) area) sellers.

Mostly information applicable to low-end and middle-end segments of market.

## Chip makers

**Chip maker** means company that develop and produce specialized System on Chips (or just chips). 
There aren`t so much such companies. Here's our list of companies whose chips we've seen.

- [Hisilicon](http://www.hisilicon.com/)
- [Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/) 
- [GrainMedia](http://www.grain-media.com/)
- [Ambarella](https://www.ambarella.com/)
- [XM](http://www.xiongmaitech.com/)

**Texas Instruments** DM365, DM368 modules were widely exist on the market about 5 years ago. 
Some their more advanced SoC DM8127 were used by [HikVision](https://www.hikvision.com/) in their exclusive hardware platforms.
Now seems they exist only in high-end segment.

**Ambarella** were exist on the market several years ago, but now seems moved their focus for action cameras and car DVRs. 
According their website they still have ip camera SoC, but seems they used not very widely and exist only in high end segment.

**GrainMedia** is a new player, they jumped in a few years ago with series of extreamly low-end solutions.

During late 2017/beginning of 2018 **XM** introduces camera modules based on their own SoC. There are no public technical info about it at the moment.

As about **HiSilicon**, that is part of Huawei corporation, their chips have firmly occupied low-end and middle-end segments. 
Ð¡ompared to competitors, HiSilicon doesn`t care much about hiding their SDKs and it can be obtain without NDA and other bullshit.
